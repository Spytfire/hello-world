My first repository 

Hello All!

Spytfire here. I am not a spiteful person, but since Spitfire was taken, I went with my alt nick. . .hipster nick? Anyway.

I have no idea what I'm doing. I've toyed with python, toyed with games to teach java, toyed with a little sql, but I am a beginner to the scripting/coding world. Be kind.

Here goes my first commit. (look at me use lingo)
